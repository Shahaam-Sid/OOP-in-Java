This repository contains practical implementations and examples as I work through core Java concepts. The focus is on building a solid foundation in Java programming before diving into data structures and algorithms.

## 📚 Topics Covered

- [**Classes & Objects**](./Classes&Objects/) - Basic Java code structure
- [**String, Wrapper Classes, Arrays & Enums**](./StringWrapperArrayEnums/) - Use of String and String Builder, Wrapper Classes, Arrays and Enums

## 🧠 Practise

- [**CreditCard**](./CreditCard/) - A Credit Card Model Class
- [**ChapOneExercises**](./ChapOneExercises/) - Chapter 1 Exercises Programs
- [**Progression**](./Progression/) - Progressions using Inheritence
- [**ChapTwoExercises**](./ChapTwoExercises/) - Chapter 2 Exercises Programs

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher
- A Java IDE (IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, VS Code) or text editor

### Running the Code

1. Clone the repository:
